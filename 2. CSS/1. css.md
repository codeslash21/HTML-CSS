## Pseudo Element
Pseudo element actually does not exist in html, but we can still select and style that with css. We use `::` to write pseudo element. Below there are some exampe of pseudo element. By default pseudo elements are inline element, so if we want to apply padding and margin we have to use `display: inline-block;` style. There are some important pseudo elements like `before`, `after`, `first-line`, `first-letter`.
