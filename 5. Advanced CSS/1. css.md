# CSS
- `*` is universal selector, this is to select all the element in the HTML document.
- `box-sizing` property dont get inherited by default, so we can use `inherit` value to force the element to use `box-sizing` value from its parent.

- By default `1 rem = 16px`, so to reset it to `10px` we can use `html` element selector, which is the parent of all html elements.
- `npm init` - run this in project folder to create `package.json` file.
- `npm install node-sass --save-dev` - to install sass compiler `node-sass` and it will be listed in `package.json` under `devDependencies`. `devDependencies` hold the packages which are needed for local developement and testing, where as `dependencies` hold the packages which are needed in the production. To save any package under `dependencies` we use only `--save` flag. For example, we put `jquery` under `dependencies` and put `node-sass` under `devDependencies`.
- `npm install` - to install all the dependencies from `package.json` file in the same folder.
- `npm uninstall jquery --save` - to unistall jquery and remove it from dependencies of package.json file.
- `npm run {script name}` - to run the script which is under `scripts` section in `package.json` file. To run a command first we have to add that to the `scripts` section like below

and then run `npm run compile:sass`. **`w`** flag is for watching means if we run the command one time then after every save of changes that will be autometically compiled to destination file, we dont have to run the command each time after making some changes.
- `sudo npm install live-server -g` - to install live server globally. Use sudo to run as admistrator.
