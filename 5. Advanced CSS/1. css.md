## CSS
- `*` is universal selector, this is to select all the element in the HTML document.
- `box-sizing` property dont get inherited by default, so we can use `inherit` value to force the element to use `box-sizing` value from its parent.

- By default `1 rem = 16px`, so to reset it to `10px` we can use `html` element selector, which is the parent of all html elements.
- We use `:` for pseudo class and `::` for pseudo element. All pseudo elements are inline elements.
- If we use `::before` pseudo element then it will be the very first child of its parent and if we use `::after` then it will become very last child of its parent. for eample, if we use `h2::before` then it will become the first child of h2 and will be shown before the main content of h2 and if we use `h2::after` then it will become the last child of h2 and will be shown after the content of h2.
- **Json sibling** of an element is the element that is immediately after that element.
```
h3 + p::first-line {

}
```
here p is the json sibling of h3 and to declare some design rules for the first line of each p which is json sibling of h3 we have to use above selector. **`+`** is called **json sibling selector** and its used to select the json sibling. `~` this is general sibling selector and this can be used to select any sibling, not necessarily immediately after.
- `>` is called **direct child selector**, using this selector we can select all direct child of the parent.

For example in the above example we are selecting all the direct children of the parent which has `section-features` as class.

- In absolute positioning and floating elements are **out of flow**.
- If all the children of an element are floating then the height of that element will be collapsed and it will be zero and this phenomena is called *collapsing of element*.
- Text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element.
- For the elements which are in normal flow their default position is relative.
- If we use `float` property for a element, then it will only work if it has defined width and height.
- If height of an element collapse because of floating of its children then to fix that 
  - we have to add an empty div with `class="clear"`
  - and add css rule as below
```
.clear {
  clear: both // if left and right float is appiled to children
         left // if only left float is applied to the child
         right // if only right float is applied to the child
```
- Another way to fix floating problem
```
// add clearfix class to that element and add the following css rule
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
  }
```
- `.` is class selector, `#` is id selector and html element name is element selector which we use in css file.
- Inherited property can be overwritten by any rule which has value for the same property. Inherited values has the lowest priority. Not all the properties get inherited to its children like border property. Mostly text related properties do get inherited.
- We use universal selector to apply property to all the elements. Generally we use this to apply certain properties which dont get inherited. But it can be overwritten as it has lowest priority.
- When two margin occupy the same space then only one margin will be visible and that is the larger one and the smaller one do get overlapped. This is called collaspsing margin.
- When we want space inside the element, which is very useful when there is background color or image, then we use padding. And, when we want to create space outside the element or between the multiple elements then we use margin.
- The type of boxes which only occupy exactly the space they needed for its content is called inline boxes or inline element.
- The boxes which occupy space as much as they can and they basically create line break after them is called block-level boxes or block-level elements. They cant be side by side with one another. This element occupy the 100% of parent's width no matter the content. Elements are stacked vertically one after another by default.
- Inline elements occupy only the space necessary for its content. Causes no lline-break before or after the element. Height and width dont apply. Padding and margin are applied horizontally (left and right). If padding is aadded on top and bottom then element position will not be changed and padding will be added by overlapping, but in case of box-level element element position is changed to accomodate the padding on top and bottom side. For example, strong, em, a, button elements.
- For inline-block elements we can set height and width and can add padding and margin in all the sides. But, it occupies only the space which is needed for its content and dont causes line-break. For example img element.
- Pseudo-class is written using `:`, these are special state of selectors. Following are some example of mostly used pseudo-class
  - `active` define active state for an html element.
  - `target` when a particular element is targeted through `a` element. For example, there is a `div` with `id="popup"` and there is one `a` which refers to `#popup`, so when we click on the `a` element `#popup` will be added to the url, and that `div` is targeted.
  - `hover` when cursor is on any html element.
  - `focus` when user focus on a html element.
  - `link` generally defines default state for links. `button` element does not have `link` state.
  - `visited` it defines the state for a link which is clicked. `button` element does not have `visited` state.
  - `checked` it generally defines state for `input` of type `radio` or checkbox which is selected.
  - `invalid` is generally related to input element and when user enter a value which is not aligned with the expected input format.
  - `placeholder-shown` is generally related to input element, and when user did not enter any value in the input field.

- `box-sizing: border-box` - border and padding will not be added to total height and width of the box. Rather if we add padding then it will take space from mentioned height and width.
- `backface-visibility: hidden` - to remvoe shakiness from animation. Its fix for that issue.
- More than one `transform` property on one declaration block will not work. If we have more than one, then only the last `transform` rule will be applied. So, solution for this is we have to place all the values of `transform` property under one `transform` property, separated by `,` `transform: skewY(2deg) skewX(15deg) scale(1.1);`.
- If we want two or more block will be side by side with same height, then we set `display: tabel-cell` for each of those blocks and `display: table` for their parent element.
- If we want a block of a text devided equally into multiple columns then we can use `column-count` property
<img width="594" height="89" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-17 at 12 32 50 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2220e28c-3a63-48d4-ae37-d4d378088045" />
- `display:none` removes the element completely from the document flow and layout, but `visibility:hidden` hides the element visually but it still occupies its original space on the page. Opposite of `visibility:hidden` is `visibility:visible`.
- If we want to display all the `block` level children side by side, then we have two options -
  - if use `float` property, then height of each child will not be the same, height of each child will depend on the content.
  - If we want to have same height for all the children irrespective of its content, then we will use `display:table` for the parent and `display:table-cell` for all the children. This technique is helpful, if we want to align the content to the center of parent container.
  - If we want the text to be devided equally to few columns, based on its content, then we have following properties to add to `p` element
  ```
  column-count: 2;  // number of columns
  column-gap: 4rem;  // gap between two columns
  column-rule: 1px solid $color-grey-light-2;  // to have a border between two columns
  ```

- If we want the word to be broken when there is not enough space and continue to the next line, then we have following property `hyphens: auto;`, this will add `-` where word is broken.

## Sass
- `npm init` - run this in project folder to create `package.json` file.
- `npm install node-sass --save-dev` - to install sass compiler `node-sass` and it will be listed in `package.json` under `devDependencies`. `devDependencies` hold the packages which are needed for local developement and testing, where as `dependencies` hold the packages which are needed in the production. To save any package under `dependencies` we use only `--save` flag. For example, we put `jquery` under `dependencies` and put `node-sass` under `devDependencies`.
- `npm install` - to install all the dependencies from `package.json` file in the same folder.
- `npm uninstall jquery --save` - to unistall jquery and remove it from dependencies of package.json file.
- `npm run {script name}` - to run the script which is under `scripts` section in `package.json` file. To run a command first we have to add that to the `scripts` section like below

and then run `npm run compile:sass`. **`w`** flag is for watching means if we run the command one time then after every save of changes that will be autometically compiled to destination file, we dont have to run the command each time after making some changes.
- `partials` sass files started with leading `_`, this means compiler will not compile these files. These files are supposed to be imported in other sass file using `@import` or `@use` keyword.
- `sudo npm install live-server -g` - to install live server globally. Use sudo to run as admistrator.
- `live-server` to start the live server in the directory, where command is executed.


## NOTE:
- On `focus` there is outline for `button` element bu default. To remove that, we can use `outline: none;` style. But for accessibility reason we should not remove the `focus` state, rather we can modify the deffault design. For example, we can use the `hover` state for `focus` state as well.
- `button` element does not have `link` and `visited` state.
- `z-index` will work for an element, if it has its position explicitly defined.
