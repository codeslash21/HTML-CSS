## Animation
- `backface-visibility: hidden;` to remove the shakiness in the animation.


## Style
- If we use `clip-path` property to design the shape of a child `div`, then `border-radius` property will not work as expected for parent container, even we use `overflow: hidden` that also will not work. So, we have to use `border-radius` property explicitly for child element. For example `border-top-left-radius: 6px;`.
